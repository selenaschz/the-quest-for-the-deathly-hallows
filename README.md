## Game Description

Lord Voldemort has returned and already possesses the **Elder Wand**, one of the three Deathly Hallows and the most powerful of all wands. 
His goal now is to obtain the remaining two Hallows to consolidate his power and rule the wizarding world: 
the **Resurrection Stone** will allow him to summon the dead and strengthen his army, while the **Invisibility Cloak** will make him undetectable while he carries out his sinister plan.

As a brave student of Hogwarts, your mission is to prevent Voldemort from obtaining these artifacts. You must explore Hogwarts and its surroundings, facing magical enemies along the way.

Use your magical abilities to overcome the obstacles in your path. The future of the wizarding world depends on you: if you manage to acquire the relics before Voldemort, 
you can save the magical community from chaos. Are you ready to become the hero that the wizarding world needs?
