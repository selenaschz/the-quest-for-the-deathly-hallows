In this **JavaScript-based game**, you must explore Hogwarts, face magical enemies, and collect the **Deathly Hallows** before Voldemort does.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
This project gave me the opportunity to strengthen my **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** skills while creating a fully interactive game. Some key concepts I worked with include:

- **Game Logic & Timers**: Managed real-time events such as spell cooldowns and timed challenges using setInterval and setTimeout.
- **OOP**: Organized the game into classes for enemies, magic items, and Deathly Hallows, using inheritance to define common properties and behaviors ensuring better structure and code reuse.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Switch between screens and display rankings.
- **Responsive Design**: Used media queries to ensure the game Menu is properly displayed across different devices.
- **State Management**: Implemented systems for managing player stats like health, score, and collected relics.
- **HTML & CSS**: Designed and structured the layout and styling of the game interface, including buttons, menus, and game screens.
